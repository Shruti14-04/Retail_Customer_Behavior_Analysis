# Retail Customer Trends Analysis

End-to-end customer behavior analytics project using python, SQL and Power BI. This project covers data cleaning, modeling, SQL-based insights, interactive dashboard from which we can draw insights easily and understand them.

## Problem Statement:

A leading retail company wants to understand its **consumer shopping behavior** to **improve sales**, **customer satisfaction**, and **long-term loyalty**. The management team has noticed changes in purchasing patterns. They are particularly interested in uncovering what factors—such as discounts, reviews, or payment preferences—drive consumer decisions and repeat purchases.
